# Documentation Development

Your documentation site is written in Vitepress, which has support for writing **Vue 3** components in-line.

You are still able to preview your Vue 2-only code within your Vitepress site, but you have to set that up.

If you're new to Vitepress, check out their [documentation](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) but in general, there are a few concepts:

1. The Theme - Installing, modifying, or otherwise playing with the runtime of your application.
2. The Build - Configure your site's smart defaults (Title, Description, Colors)
3. The Content - Markdown files.
