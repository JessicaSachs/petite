<!--
  Shared HTML setup code.
  Use this file for things like globally installed deps.
  If you ever need Vue {2,3}-only HTML setup code, then
  change the relevant HTML config in the relevant package's
  cypress.config.ts file.

  Think: fonts, icon fonts. Anything you'd put in index.html.
  You have access to all of the normal Vite transforms + vars.
